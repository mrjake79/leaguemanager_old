hi , i am trying to use your league manager plug in to do a snooker and pool website for my local leagues , it would be great if u could put the following in to a table ,, 

Team name - Played - Won - Drawn - Lost - For - Against - Points 

 If for example on a pool match we have 8 players and we win 5 - 3 , then we would win 2 points for the win or 1 if we were to draw , but it breaks down more than that , if i was to win my game then the balls left for the other player goes on my For score ! if i lose and have 6 balls left it will go on as against ,, 

snooker is the same , if i win a frame say for example 68 to 24 , then the scores add up to the end of the season ! 

It would be great if u could try and figure this out , as its a great application ,,, regards richie

Hey Kolja,

Sorry no not really.

I'l try to explain, I think I might have found what you dont understand and understandably so because I failed to explain it properly.

I failed to see the confusion with the point that is scored during the game and the points for winning each consecutive game.

http://soccertackle.com/image/image/47/gaelic-vlarge.png
(This is a picture of a Gaelic Football goal)

As shown and as you know, when the ball is kicked into the net (or goal) a goal is rewarded. This has a value of 3 points.

If the ball is kicked over the bar and between the two up-rights (posts) 1 point is awarded.

So if eg. Carlow was playing Wicklow in a football match and Carlow scored 3 goals (in the net) and 10 points (over the bar) and Wicklow scored 1 goals (in the net) and 12 points (over the bar) Carlow would win.

This is because the value of goals added to points is 19 for carlow but only 15 for wicklow.

Goals 3 = 9 points
             +10 points
        __________
Result =   19 points

Goals 1 = 3 points
             +12 points
        __________
Result =   15 points

Attached I have a rough composition of how this would look in the table. 

In the results section it would be the very same as soccer or alot of sports just with the addition of the points eg.

22/3/09                   Carlow (3-15)  -  (1-12) Wicklow

or something like that.

Sorry Kolja, I dont mean to take you from your studies.

Dear Kolja,
 
I have some suggestions for the plug-in, although I have to state that you have done an absolutely fantastic job already,
and I really appreciate all the time and effort you put in. I just hope you consider the suggestions I have. If not, of course it's fully understandable!
 
- In the admin section 'Add new post' the Match-Report widget, where you can select a match for your post. 
   
     It would be nice if it would be working with different dropdown menu's where you can first select the league you are looking for,
    and then the season. If you now have many leagues and many seasons it's hard to find the correct match.
 
- With the following line: [leaguestandings league_id=1 mode=compact]
 
    A nice addition would be that you can do it like this [leaguestandings league_name=Seniors mode=compact]
    If there is a possibility to insert the standings through a name, it would be more dynamically. And therefore more easy
    if you want to use WordPress as a CMS for local clubs with different teams for example.
 
- A template page for teams from one club.
    
    I was thinking that it would be totally awesome if there would be an option like this
 
    In the admin section there would be an option where you can insert a team name, select the league from that team.
    It should give the following output:
 
    Teamname-------------------------------leaguetable
    Information about the team--------upcoming matches
    -----------------------------------------------recent matches
 
 
These were just some examples of how I would interpret things with the league manager. I hope you find it useful. I'm not sure if everything is clear enough,
but if you would consider implementing these things you can always ask me what I meant. I also read on your blog you're at an internship at the moment,
so I understand you're quite busy!
 
Awaiting for your reply..
 
Best Regards,
 
Arjan Drees
