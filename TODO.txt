Curling Rules (John Meenderman [johnmeenderman@gmail.com])

2 teams play against each other, a match goes over Ends(curling term) there are sometimes 6 Ends but it also can go 8 Ends this depends on the tournament. In every End 1 team can write stones(0-8). At the end of the match,the stones of both Teams are counted together and that is the end result. For a win you get a 2 points, for a draw 1 and for loss 0. In a league table the team with the most points is leader but if there are two teams with equal points then it depends on how many Ends a team has wrote(won) but if there also equal then it will depend on how many stones they have made. So the league table always shows Points/Ends/Stones.

Example Of a Match

Ends           1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8    End result
 Team Swiss    2       1    1      2   0             6
 Team Eng           3          1           1         5

Example of League table

      Team          Points      Ends    Stones
1. Team Swiss         2           5        6
2. Team Ger           2           5        5
3. Team Scot          2           4        8
2. Team Eng           0           3        5
